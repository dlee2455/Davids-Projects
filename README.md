**Second-Price Auction Strategy Algorithm**
•  Engineered a high-performing bidding algorithm for an online ad auction simulation. The algorithm strategically balanced the exploration of user behavior against the exploitation of known data to optimize ad placements amidst aggressive competitors.
•  Conducted extensive simulations and iterative testing, which resulted in my algorithm achieving the highest performance score in the class, indicating superior efficacy in maximizing client’s ad revenues while adhering to budget constraints.
